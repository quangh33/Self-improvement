#### Hide code
- symptom: hide in a cave, work, work, work, then polish, polish. Only unveil your work
when you're done.
- reason:
    - scare of judgement
    - fear that other might take your idea
- hiding is harmful:
    - increase the risk of unnecessary failure => need collaboration and review 
    - easy to make fundamental design mistake early on => fail early, fail fast, fail often
    - working alone increase the chance that when you leave, other cannot continue your work.
    > Bus factor:the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your project is completely doomed.
- teamwork is the best route to producing great software
    
##### Genius myth
- people tend to ascribe the success of a team to a single person/ leader.
- natural instinct to find leader, role models, idolize them and imitate them.
- anyone — genius or not — with poor social skills tends to be a poor teammate.

#### Three pillar of social interaction
##### Humility

You are not the center of the universe (nor is your code!). You’re open to self-improvement.
##### Respect

You genuinely care about others you work with. 
You treat them kindly and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.
##### Trust
You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, 
and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate

> When you’ve got richer relationships with your coworkers, 
> they’ll be more willing to go the extra mile when you need them.

##### Three Pillars in practice
1. Lose the ego
    - Even if you know you’re the wisest person in the discussion, don’t wave it in people’s faces
    - Try to build a sense of team accomplishment and group pride
2. Give & take criticism
    - **you are not your code, your coworkers is not their code**
    - wrong way to criticize
    > Man, you totally got the control flow wrong on that method there. You should be using the standard xyzzy code pattern like everyone else.
    - better way to criticize
    > Hey, I’m confused by the control flow in this section here. I wonder if the xyzzy code pattern might make this clearer and easier to maintain?
    - anti-pattern:
        - telling someone they are **wrong**
        - demanding them to change something
        - making them feel stupid

3. Be open to influence
    - it is OK for someone else to change your mind

4. Googley
    - Thrives in ambiguity
    - Values feedback
    - Challenges status quo
    - Puts the user first
    - Cares about the team
    - Does the right thing
