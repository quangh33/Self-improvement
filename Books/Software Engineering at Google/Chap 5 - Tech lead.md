#### Why?
> Someone has to lead, so why not you?
- Scale yourself: raise beyond the amount of code a single person can write.
- You might just be excellent at it.

#### Manager's disease
- micromanaging
- ignoring low performers
    - the most difficult cases are when someone just isn’t capable of doing their job no matter how long or hard they work.
    => solutions:
        - setup a time frame (say, 2 months) and small, incremental goals for them
        - meet every week to check on progress
- hiring pushovers:
    - hiring people who aren’t as smart or ambitious as you are, or just people who are more insecure than you
- ignore human issues 
- be everyone's friend   
- compromise the hiring bar
    - interview 40-50 people, pick best 5 candidates => the fastest way to build a mediocre team
- treat your team like children

> people tend to act the way you treat them, so if you treat them like children or prisoners, don’t be surprised when that’s how they behave

> The anachronistic carrot and stick is ineffective and harmful to the productivity of creative people.

> Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).

#### Advices
- If an individual succeeds, praise them in front of the team. If an individual fails, give constructive criticism in private.
- If you try to achieve an impossible goal, there’s a good chance you’ll fail, but if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you’ll most likely accomplish far more than you would have accomplished had you merely attempted something you knew you could complete.
=> It's OK to fail.

- Lose the Ego
    - Humility !== Lacking of confidence
    - Trust
    - Apologize when you make a mistake
- Be a Zen master
    - Mediating your reactions and maintaining your calm
    - Asking question: when team member asks you for advices => ask them questions which
    usually lead them to the answer whether you have the answer   
    
- Avoid compliment sandwich => most people won't
hear the critical message

> We’re quite sure that you’re not aware of this, but the way that you’re interacting with the team is alienating and angering them, and if you want to be effective, you need to refine your communication skills, 
and we’re committed to helping you do that.    

- Track happiness
    - ask member what do they need in one-on-one
    - ask member to rate their happiness on a scale of 1 to 10
    
- Delegate but get your hands dirty
    - usually by taking on a grungy task that no one else wants to do
