> If writing code is analogous to chopping down trees, your job as a leader is to “see the forest through the trees” and find a workable path through that forest, directing engineers toward the important trees.

#### 3 Always of leadership
##### Always be deciding
1. Identify the Blinder
- Blinder: people who work on a project so long that they
cannot consider the status quo critically. They made a bunch of
assumptions about the problem or solution without realizing it.
- Being unfamiliar with the problem is often an advantage.

2. Identify the trade-off
3. Decide, then iterate

##### Always be Leaving
- get your organization to solve ambiguous problems by itself
1. Dividing the problem space
2. Delegating subproblems to leaders
3. Adjusting and iterating

> 95% observation and listening, and 5% making critical adjustments in just the right place
>
##### Always be Scaling
- How to work mostly on important things rather than urgent things:
    - Delegate
    - Schedule dedicated time: block out 2h or more to sit and work
    only on important-not-urgent thing: team strategy, career path for your members,...
    - Find a tracking system that works

#### Protect your energy
- take real vacation
- take real weekend
- get up and walk around
