![](../images/46d45a93.png)

- Insight
    - abstract complexity
    - understand trade-offs
- Leadership
    - maintain control: monitoring implementation
- Vision
    - focus on big picture: understand the system works as a whole
- Communication
    - explain the architecture
    - inspire, mentor and educates the teams about the solution

2. Personalities
- Steadfast
- Trustworthy
- Confident: passion for success
- Persuasive: pick 2: better, faster, cheaper

3. Common pitfalls
- Tech lead loses Trust
    - empower your tech lead
    - open to feedback
    - change the architecture if needed
- Planning is too optimistic: engineers skip code review/ testing because of the deadline
    - Find the reason: optimistic PM, naive tech lead or slow devs?
    - Bring PM in on the dev team
    - Coach tech lead, alter planning, restructure devs
- The Architect role holds no Power: organization consider you as document producer
    - Educate the C-section
    - Team up with PM, QA, FA, LD
    - Take the ownership of the whole process
    - Leave if the org is unwilling to change

4. Issues:
- Communication:
    - Blaming: attack person, instead of behaviour
    - Defensiveness: 
    - Contempt: name calling, sarcasm, belittling
    - Stonewalling: cutting off communication
